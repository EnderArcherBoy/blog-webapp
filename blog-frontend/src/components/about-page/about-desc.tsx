            <p>This Website ( Novatus Global ) is a simple platform that allows users to write and manage their own articles easily. With the main feature of adding articles, users can create and share their writing directly without certain category restrictions. The writing process is made as efficient as possible with a minimalist interface that supports complete focus on content creation.
             </p>
            <br />
            <p>Apart from the writing feature, we also provides a special dashboard for each user to manage their articles. Through this dashboard, users can see a list of articles they have created, edit or delete as needed. This feature gives users complete control in organizing their content, making it a convenient place to organize and update posts at any time.</p>
            <br />
            <p>However, as a platform that is still in the development stage, our website has several limitations. Currently, there is no comments feature available, so readers cannot provide direct feedback on published articles. In addition, this platform does not yet support a content filter system, so all articles will be displayed without filtering by category or popularity. Nonetheless, this simplicity makes Article a great choice for those who just want to focus on writing and sharing their thoughts without the distraction of additional features.</p>
